# Kyber Crystals

## Project Overview
Kyber Crystals is my first attempt at hand-coding CSS, combined with a project that explores and simulates the properties of fictional crystals inspired by popular science fiction. This project aims to provide a platform for understanding their behavior, characteristics, and potential applications in various scenarios.

## Features

- Customizable parameters for experimentation.
- Exportable data for further analysis.
- Handcrafted CSS for styling and layout.
